# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices using **Logistic Regression**. The model's performance has been evaluated using precision, recall, and the F1-score. The goal is to identify the best model for car price prediction.

### Best Model:
- **Regularization**: Ridge
- **Method**: Mini-batch Gradient Descent
- **Final Training Loss**: 0.9015
